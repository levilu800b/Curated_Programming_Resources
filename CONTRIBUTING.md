# Contributing

Due to lack of time on my part, I tend to be very conservative about accepting
requests or new resources.

I prefer to personally vet all resources before I feel comfortable enough to
accept them, and so it might take a few weeks to a few months for me to fully
evaluate the resource, depending on how much spare time I have.

That said, if you have a resource recommendation or any suggestions for improvement,
feel free to file them in the issue tracker or submit a pull request.

Please keep in mind that at present time that I will generally NOT accept:

1.  Resources specific to a particular library or framework.

    Currently, this resource is more oriented towards collecting resources for
    learning programming languages. I unfortunately don't have the time to do a
    thorough evaluation of all the different popular frameworks currently in use.

2.  Content which can only be accessed through payment.

    I _will_ make multiple exceptions to this rule, especially for books or
    for paid content which has a good number of positive critical reviews.
    Basically, I need some way of verifying that a given resource is
    high-quality, either by reading it myself or by relying on reviews by
    others.

Please note that the goal of this collection is to create an annotated list of
high-quality resources suitable for beginners or people wanting to improve their
skill in an existing category. This collection is **not** meant to be an exhaustive
list of every single possible resource, since that might be overwhelming for
beginners.

In addition, if you feel that two existing resources are very similar and that
having both of them adds no value, or if one resource is too low-quality, please
open a discussion on the issue tracker.
